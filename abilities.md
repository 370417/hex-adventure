So, I've been thinking about how to make my game interesting, and I coincidentally watched a couple of talks about similarities between board and video game design. One topic that came up in both talks was input and output randomness. Input randomness is randomness that affects your decision, like which card you play of a random hand. Output randomness is randomness that affects the outcome of your decision, like rolling dice for combat. 

Both types of randomness have their merits, but I want to focus on input randomness, more out of curiosity than anything else. The first thing that came to mind was actually those penalty kick games with a power and direction meter that go back and forth. In those games, you try to stop the meter at the right time to determine the direction and power with which you shoot the ball. Of course, these games are actually an example of output, not input, randomness, since the goalie's behavior is random, but the player's is skill-based.
